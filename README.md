ingewikkeld/oauth-server-bundle
===============================

A bundle that contains standard stuff for an OAuth server (for use with friendsofsymfony/oauth-server-bundle). This code was originally part of the [Resourceful](http://github.com/ingewikkeld/resourceful) project. It was moved
to a seperate library to allow the inclusion of this code in other codebases than Resourceful, and to split logic
from configuration.

More documentation will follow soon
